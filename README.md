## Zeiterfassung Abschluss Projekt

# Introduction

This repository contains the codebase for a time tracking application, built as part of a final project. The project is designed using PHP with MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and includes a custom-built routing mechanism. It also incorporates JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and session management. The front-end is developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Features

PHP MVC Architecture: The backend is structured using the MVC pattern, allowing for organized and maintainable code.
Custom Router: A custom router is implemented for handling HTTP requests without relying on any external frameworks.
JWT Token Initialization: Secure user authentication and session management using JSON Web Tokens.
Front-End Development:
JavaScript: For interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
HTML: Structuring the web content.
CSS: Note that styling is yet to be implemented, so the current state lacks visual design.
